# Subtitled Videos Folder

This folder stores the output video files with embedded subtitles generated by the `auto-subtitle` process. Each job gets its own subfolder, identified by a unique job ID.

## OS Compatibility
This project is designed to be compatible with Unix-like operating systems, including macOS and Linux. While the core Python application might run on Windows, the `manage.sh` script and `ffmpeg` dependencies are primarily tested and supported on macOS and Linux environments.
