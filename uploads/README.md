# Uploads Folder

This folder is used to temporarily store video and audio files uploaded by users through the web interface for subtitle generation.

## OS Compatibility
This project is designed to be compatible with Unix-like operating systems, including macOS and Linux. While the core Python application might run on Windows, the `manage.sh` script and `ffmpeg` dependencies are primarily tested and supported on macOS and Linux environments.
